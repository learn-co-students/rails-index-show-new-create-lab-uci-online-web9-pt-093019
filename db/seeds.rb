# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:

Coupon.create(coupon_code: 'x7djje8', store: 'Safeway')
Coupon.create(coupon_code: 'CLEANSPRING', store: 'Sephora')
Coupon.create(coupon_code: '123456', store: 'REI')
